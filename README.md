# WebScraper
This project asks the user for a specified job interest, location, skills, and things they would like to see from a job(ex: health insurane). 
After getting this data the program will search on Indeed for jobs of whatever sort and location, collect data about each job from the html content,
and search through the descriptions of the job to match it with the specified skills and interests of the user. The data and information about the 
jobs plus the amount of matches with the inputs the user gave is given to help the user find the best job for them. A link is also appended for easy
application access.
