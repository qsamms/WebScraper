# WebScraper
User inputs data of a specified job and location, querys on indeed for jobs matching that postion. Scrapes data from the site on the jobs and dispays them
for the user. So far I just have this part workingn but I'm not finished with this project yet.

Planning on asking the user for more input like experience and skills, keywords, their home location or address in order to give each job a "score" 
depending on how well thier data matches the description of each job. I'll display this to the user as such so each job listing has some sort of ranking.
